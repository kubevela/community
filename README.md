## Introduction

KubeVela is a modern software delivery platform based on OAM(Open Application Model) that makes deploying and operating applications across today's hybrid, multi-cloud environments easier, faster and more reliable.

KubeVela is infrastructure agnostic, programmable, yet most importantly, application-centric. It allows you to build powerful software, and deliver them anywhere!

Visit [kubevela.io](https://kubevela.io/) for information about KubeVela.

## KubeVela authors

KubeVela is an open source project with an active development community. The project was evolved from [oam-kubernetes-runtime](https://github.com/crossplane/oam-kubernetes-runtime) and initialized by the open source community with [bootstrap contributors](https://github.com/kubevela/community/blob/main/OWNERS.md#bootstrap-contributors) from 8+ different organizations.

## Communication

We want your contributions and suggestions! One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions, chat on IM or join the bi-weekly community calls.

### Community meetings

Every week we host a community meeting to showcase new features, review upcoming milestones, and engage in a Q&A. All are welcome!

The next 3 upcoming community meetings are pinned as issues in this repository and can be used to enter in suggestions for the meeting. If you would like to talk about suggestions first use the CNCF Slack (`#kubevela-dev` channel) to discuss. The meeting agenda is finalized by a community call host.

Community members (members of the KubeVela GitHub org) can nominate themselves via an issue on the `kubevela/community` repository to be a community call host. Members become approved community call hosts when two or more existing community hosts approve their request.

To accomodate different timezones and languages, we schedule community calls at different times zone and use English and Chinese languages one by one.

### KubeVela blog

The [KubeVela blog](https://kubevela.io/blog) has regular posts on releases, technical articles and upcoming events. If you would like to author a post, reach out to us with a suggestion. 

## How can I get involved?

One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions at community engagements.

If you're looking for something to work on, read the [contribution guidelines](https://kubevela.io/docs/contributor/overview) and then you start by looking for GitHub issues, marked with ["good first issue"](https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) or the ["help wanted"](https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) labels.

And, we can always use more testing, have more and improved docs, or just write a blog post on what you have discovered whilst using KubeVela.

KubeVela adopts [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
