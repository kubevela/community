            KubeVela Community Meetings

            Every two weeks we host a community meeting to showcase new features, review upcoming milestones, and engage in Q&A with the KubeVela community - all are welcome, and we encourage participation.

            The purpose of this thread is to form a discussion amongst the KubeVela community on potential topics to highlight during the meeting. If you have a topic you wish to present or learn more about, please comment and be sure to include your name and a short description of the topic.

            The conversations in this thread will directly influence the meeting agenda for the community call on Tuesday ${{ env.MEETINGDAY }} 07:30 AM PST. The meeting agenda will be finalized by a Community Call Host days prior to the meeting.

            Thank you and we look forward to hearing your input.
